# Gizmo

A Windows WPF Information Technology utility application to help with IT and DevOps support tasks.

## Getting Started

This is under extreme development, using pre-release software.  .NET Core 3.0 is being reviewed 
as a potential platform for the rewrite of this tool that current resides as a non-open source
WinForm .NET Framework application.

### Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio 2019 Preview Release](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)
- [.NET Core 3.0 Preview Release](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0)

## Acknowledgments

This is based on the utility ToolSaq, which started in 2003 and re-written twice on the .NET 
Framework using MDI and Infragistics.  
This is an attempt to give back to the development community in the spirit of open source, while 
modernizing the tool, as we now take advantage of Nuget and other free tools.

Software development is inspired by creativity and the desire to create useful things.
